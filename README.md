Code-2040
=========
As a first time coder, I found these stages to be extremely challenging, but enlightening and encouraging nonetheless. I found myself finding a great abundance of resources, both helpful and unhelpful, that helped to enhance my skills.

Because the given concepts were somewhat new to me, I configured a way to complete the challenges with my given skill set. Finding online codes that accomplished the necessary tasks, I taught myself what each method was achieving and how the overall code was working. After this process of understanding, I worked with other students from my engineering classes and configured the best ways to accomplish the given tasks.

For steps that needed to be repeated for each challenge, I discovered codes that I found comprehensible and ones that I felt I could modify and clean up on my own. After understanding what each task's purpose was, the next difficult step was creating and understanding a code that was efficient and did exactly what was being asked to be done.
